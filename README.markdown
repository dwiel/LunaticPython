Lunatic Python
==============

**Lunatic Python** is a two-way bridge between `Python`_ and `Lua`_,
allowing these languages to intercommunicate. Being two-way means that
it allows Lua inside Python, Python inside Lua, Lua inside Python
inside Lua, Python inside Lua inside Python, and so on.

This is an improved version of Lunatic Python 1.0, as written by
Gustavo Niemeyer and available from http://labix.org/lunatic-python.

Zach Dwiel has made some small changes to allow easy compilation on
Ubuntu running lua5.1.  It has been testing on Ubuntu 9.04 and 10.04
